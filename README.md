# LitlCore

This is a little library in OCaml about enumerators and containers. It contains two generic structures: binary trees and binary
maps (which are just binary trees with an extra slot for storing data), queues (which are an implementation of [finger trees](http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html) ([pdf file](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/17e7/8b45eb775fe286b3763adc78fdd85a3c09e4.pdf)) and a multi-purpose enumerator type.
